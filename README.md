# 📚 Learning Progress & Projects
This repository tracks my progress in learning data analysis, machine learning, and related topics. Here you'll find notebooks, code experiments, notes, and project files.
## 🎯 Goals
- Organize what I learn  
- Solidify knowledge through hands-on coding  
- Keep a reference I can return to later  
- Share learning progress with others
## 📆 Topics I'm Working On
- Python for data analysis  
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Regression, classification, and ML models  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
